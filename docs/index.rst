Understanding Your PC Matic Purchase
------------------------------------

PC Matic licenses are typically sold as yearly or multi-year subscriptions that cover multiple devices, depending on the plan. Once purchased, you receive access to:

- The PC Matic software installer
- A user account linked to your email address
- A license key or authentication linked to your login
- Access to the customer dashboard and support tools

It’s important to keep a record of the email used during purchase, as this will be your primary method for accessing the software in the future.

What You Need Before Downloading
--------------------------------

Before downloading PC Matic, make sure you have the following:

- A stable internet connection
- Administrator privileges on your computer
- Your registered email address and password for the PC Matic account
- Access to the device where you plan to install the software
- Any previously saved copy of the installer, if available (optional)

If you don’t remember your login credentials, you can reset your password through the login interface. Having access to the registered email will make the process much easier.

Steps to Download PC Matic After Purchase

Here is a detailed step-by-step guide to downloading PC Matic when you've already purchased the software:

Step One: Go to the Official PC Matic Website
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a secure web browser and manually enter the official web address of the PC Matic homepage. This avoids the risk of being directed to a third-party or fraudulent website.

Step Two: Access the User Login Section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Look for a login or "My Account" section. This is typically located at the top right corner of the page. Click to open the login screen.

Step Three: Sign in with Your Registered Email
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enter the email address and password you used at the time of purchase. If you have forgotten your password, click the "Forgot Password" option to receive a reset link.

Once logged in, you’ll gain access to your customer dashboard.

Step Four: Navigate to the Downloads Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Within your dashboard, find the section labeled “Downloads” or “Install Software.” This area provides links to the latest version of PC Matic available for your operating system.

Click the appropriate download button for your device—typically Windows, but other versions may be available depending on your license.

Step Five: Download the Installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Click the download button to begin downloading the installer file. Most browsers will prompt you to confirm the download or ask for a save location. Choose a familiar folder like “Downloads” or your desktop.

Step Seven: Activate Your License
